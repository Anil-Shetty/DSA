# Data Structures in TypeScript

This repository contains TypeScript implementations of various data structures commonly used in computer science and software development. Each data structure is implemented as a separate class, providing a clean and modular approach for using and understanding these fundamental concepts.

## Data Structures Implemented

- [Stack](#stack)
- [Queue](#queue)
- [Linked List](#linked-list)
- [Binary Search Tree](#binary-search-tree)

## Stack

The `Stack` class represents a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. It supports operations such as pushing elements onto the stack, popping elements off the stack, peeking at the top element without removing it, and printing the stack contents.

## Queue

The `Queue` class represents a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. It supports operations such as enqueueing elements into the queue, dequeuing elements from the queue, peeking at the front element without removing it, and printing the queue contents.

## Linked List

The `LinkedList` class represents a linked list data structure. It supports operations such as adding elements to the list, inserting elements at specific positions, removing elements from the list, and printing the list contents.

## Binary Search Tree

The `BinarySearchTree` class represents a binary search tree data structure. It supports operations such as inserting elements into the tree, removing elements from the tree, performing traversals (inorder, preorder, and postorder), searching for elements in the tree, and more.

## Usage

Each data structure class can be instantiated with the desired type, and methods can be called to perform operations on the data structure. See the documentation in each class file for details on available methods and usage examples.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and explore the source code. You can also integrate these data structures into your TypeScript projects to leverage their functionality.
